 Hi, I'm Amit and this is my second semester project that I developed with my friend.

 This project aims to develop a Student Result Management System that 
simplifies the process of recording, managing, and viewing student 
results. 
Using JSP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, the system provides a robust 
solution that is accessible and user-friendly. It automates the entire 
process from data entry to result generation, allowing for easy input of 
student information, updates to records, and the generation of result 
reports. 
This digital platform enhances efficiency, accuracy, and convenience in 
managing student results, benefiting both administrators and students.
